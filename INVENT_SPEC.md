Rank the provided code snippets relative to each other based on cognitive clarity. Cognitive clarity measures how easily the entire logic can be understood as a unified whole. Evaluate how many distinct concepts, layers, or moving parts must be held in mind simultaneously to understand each snippet. Determine whether the code's intent, purpose, and primary behavior are transparently apparent on reading, or whether understanding requires navigating hidden complexity and inferring implicit assumptions. Rank from most cognitively clear (code whose purpose and behavior can be easily grasped as one complete mental model) to least cognitively clear (code that requires holding multiple contexts and inferring behavior).
