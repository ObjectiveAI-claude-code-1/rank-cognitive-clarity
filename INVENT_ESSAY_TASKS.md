**Task 1: Assess Conceptual Unity**
Evaluate the degree to which the code snippet functions as a single, coherent idea versus fragmenting into multiple disconnected or loosely-related components. Examine whether the logic flows continuously and naturally from beginning to end, creating a sense that each line builds inevitably on what came before. Determine how many distinct concepts, threads, or layers the reader must simultaneously hold in mind to understand the snippet. Identify whether implicit state, side effects, scattered logic across multiple scopes, or leaking abstractions force awareness of multiple moving parts. Rate the snippet on how well it pursues one clear purpose through logically unified progression.

**Task 2: Assess Transparency of Intent**
Evaluate how readily apparent the purpose and primary behavior of the code are upon reading, without requiring inference, navigation of hidden complexity, or knowledge of implicit assumptions. Examine the clarity of naming conventions and whether variable and function names transparently communicate their purpose. Assess whether the control flow is straightforward and reads naturally, or whether it requires decoding of clever constructs and language idioms. Determine whether the main purpose of the code is obvious immediately, or whether understanding requires tracing through convoluted logic, making assumptions, and consulting external knowledge. Rate the snippet on how explicitly and obviously it communicates what it does and why it does it.
